# Climate Data Analysis and Forecasting with Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast monthly temperatures based on historical weather data. By analyzing climate data, the model provides insights into temperature trends and seasonal patterns, aiding in better understanding and future planning.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive regression model to forecast monthly temperatures.
- Analyze historical weather data to uncover trends and seasonal variations.
- Visualize temperature predictions to facilitate decision-making.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive weather dataset, which includes various climatic parameters over the years.

## Key Features
- Built a predictive regression model using TensorFlow and Keras for temperature forecasting.
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the weather dataset for analysis.
- Visualized temperature predictions to analyze trends and enhance understanding of seasonal patterns.
